### Description of the Topology

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![Diagram](https://github.com/bnicholson17/ELK-Stack-project/blob/2f63038347b753f5a4656f024a8e8fd9cd47a24e/Network%20Diagram/Diagram.PNG)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the Damn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting inbound access to the network. Load balancers 
ensure that web traffic will be processed and shared by all 3 vulnerable web servers. The Access controls in place ensure that only authorized 
users are able to connect.
Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the file systems of the VMs on the network 
as well as watching system metrics.
- Filebeat watches and monitors log files and collects log events.
- Metricbeat collects metrics and statistics. Metricbeat allows you to monitor services and system usage on your servers. 

The configuration details of each virtual machine may be found below.

### Access Policies

The web servers on the internal network are not publicly accessible. They can only be accessed via the ansible container installed on the jumpbox via ssh.
Only the JumpBox via port 22 and the ELK server via port 5601 are publicly accessible, although inbound security rules ensure only my private IP has access. 

In addition to being accessible via port 5601, the ELK server can also be accessed by using ssh from the JumpBox. 

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. Using Ansible playbooks allow us to automate the configuration of multiple servers at the same time.
This is extremely time-efficient and saves us from having to manually configure each server. In addition to this, Ansible playbooks are human readable, allowing users to easily write and edit
playbooks and configuration files. 

The playbook implements the following tasks:

-  Install Docker (eg. docker.io)  
-  Install python3-pip
-  Download and launch a docker (sebp/elk:761)
-  Enable service docker on boot

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- web-1 10.0.0.5
- web-2 10.0.0.6
- web-3 10.0.0.9

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- ***Metricbeat***
- ***Filebeat***

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

- ***Filebeat*** is a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing log data. Filebeat captures and monitor log files that you specify, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing. For example Filebeat allows you to monitor syslogs to detect various things such as sudo commands or SSH logins. 

- ***Metricbeat*** is a lightweight shipper that collects metrics from the operating system and from services running on a server. For example Metricbeat allows you to monitor CPU usage and RAM statistics.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the Playbooks we have created, you first need to ssh into your Ansible control node, which in this case is our JumpBox ( ssh RedAdmin@52.189.250.82 )

You'll then need to follow the below steps ;
- Start your Ansible container  (sudo docker start container name)
- Attach your Ansible container (sudo docker attach container name) 
- Update the hosts file to add the webservers and ELK server  (nano /etc/ansible/hosts)
- ![Diagram](https://github.com/bnicholson17/ELK-Stack-project/blob/4841b51bb14c7305227133e73e2f82cf7cde317c/extra%20screenshots/host-config.PNG)
- update the config files to include the ELK severs private IP.
- Ensure the playbooks are in the file location stated in the config files.
- run the playbooks :
  -                                    $ ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/install_elk.yml 
  -                                    $ ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/install_filebeat.yml 
  -                                    $ ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/install_metricbeat.yml 
																			
Head to your browser and enter - http://[your.VM.IP]:5601/app/kibana - to verify that the playbooks have run successfully. The webpage should appear and you should be able to use filebeat and metricbeat to capture and monitor data from your webservers. 

We should now have 3 functioning web servers, placed behind a load balancer, which we are now able to monitor using the beats we have installed.


See examples of Kibana's home screen and confirmation of filebeat and metricbeat working correctly.
